# Infinity World Introduction - Lite Edition


## Background 

**Infinity World** is a new concept compared with blockchain or decentralized applications, aiming to provide a consistent protocol for emerging innovation.  

Etherum foundation has proposed a related wording to describe the momentum, named as  

[Infinite Garden](https://ethereum.foundation/infinitegarden), which is an embodiment of the spirit of the Ethereum Foundation as one gardener in a vast ecosystem.

ZenFox Labs outlines the core features of Infinity World as below.

1. Autonomous For Machine to Machine
2. Unstoppable Computing Platform for Jobs Running
3. Sustainable & Composable Protocol for Participants


## Architect


Above three features still in the high level picture, we go for mapping the target goals to workable techniques, including **advanced AI algorithms, Scalable Smart Contract Platform**, and **VR/MR**.

### Advanced AI 

**Generative AI** and **Reinforcement Learning** will bring new possibilities to game content generation and intelligent agent interaction. **AI Agent** could be the bridge between machines, to create an **Autonomous World** loop in a variety of players.

GenAI cloud generates the native digital content and world map based on the protocol or parameters server, which is governed by the decentralized stakeholders. 

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) is an excellent example of generative AI that creates images based on text prompts. It has become one of the most popular tools for creating AI art, along with Dall-E and Stable Diffusion

In addition to the creation of content, Reinforcement Learning is another key success to give the machine ability to learn by the environment and build the autonomous system in a limited set of rules. 

Google introduced a framework to create AI agents that can understand human instructions and perform actions in open-ended settings, [Building interactive agents in video game worlds](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-interactive-agents-in-video-game-worlds). 


### Infinity Computing Platform 

The definition of an infinite computing platform includes various computing scenarios, such as data storage, messaging, and logical computing, which could run the infinite worldâ€™s job in an Open and Unstoppable way.

Ethereum proposed the first infinity computing platform, named as smart contract, could bring the simple job run as the decentralized way. However, it is still in the early stage, the massive adoption blocked by the bad performance and high cost. 

L2/L3 or Game Chain is one of potential solutions for high frequency transactions, but we still need to put efforts into a more fundamental layer to exchange the performance, including **P2P network, P2P storage and Privacy Reserved Algorithm**.


### World Game Rule & Value Protocol

Back to the ERC-721 standard, NFT assets have been proposed , which is used to express the value of game roles and props. However,  it is still a static and limited way to tokenize a few of the behaviors in the game process. We need to build more scale protocols to express the games, EIP-4907 is one of the instances that brings a rentable NFT game to demonstrate the infinite world.

Apart from the game assets expression, **game parameters server** is the key component to earn the community trust. There is a huge potential open question on how to formulate a game root parameter protocol (EIP-Root Parameters).


### VR 

Virtual Reality tends to bring people to a mixed machine world, acting as an agent to interact to NPC in an infinity map. Apple's first MR device, the Apple Vision Pro, breaks the limitations of traditional displays and adopts a new three-dimensional user interface to achieve natural interaction through the user's eyes, gestures and voice. It may be able to break the constraints of industry hardware and bring MR into real games.


## Next for ZenFox Labs

This is a new era for online space with the capability to build an Autonomous World for humans and machines. ZenFox Labs keep tracking the progress, and will be devoted to build the protocol and engineering PoC for the whole Infinity Space.
